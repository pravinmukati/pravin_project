1.git init
2.git remote add origin "https://github.com/Prafulljohri/Git-Test.git"
3.git pull origin master
	git	fetch command pulls the data to your local repository
	git pull command automatically fetch and then merge a remote branch into your current branch

4.git status
5.git add .  lets you to add your file to your index
6.git commit -a -m " "   -> -a for all files
7.git log
		git log --oneline for shorter version
8.git log -p -2 for last 2 commits
9.git push [remote-name] [branch-name]


Branches
	-Local Branches
	-Remote-tracking branches
1.git branch branchname
2.git checkout branchname -> switching for branch

Merging
1.git checkout master
2.git merge <branch wich you want to merge>

Rebasing --> Another type of merging
		-can be used to make linear sequence of commits
		-With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one
1. git checkout master
2. git rebase firstbranch


Revert
------
	git revert HEAD
	1.git log
	2.git checkout ea8eb134 text

Unstaging a Staged File

	git reset HEAD benchmarks.rb
	
Unmodifying a Modified File
